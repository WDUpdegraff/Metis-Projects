For this project, I examined the determinants of box office success in terms of the ratio of total gross to budget and built a model to predict films worth investing in, based on data scraped from boxofficemojo.

The three files in scraping code were used to assemble and clean the data, a CSV of which is attached. The analysis and model building was performed in the model notebook.
